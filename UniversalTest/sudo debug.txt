Hi guys,

As a workaround, you can decorate existing gdb binary with a bash script and then use it.
Steps are,

cd /usr/bin

sudo mv gdb gdborig

Now you need to create a bash script named gdb with following content.

sudo vim gdb
Content of the bash is;
#!/bin/sh
sudo gdborig $@

Finally, make the script runnable.
sudo chmod 0755 gdb

Then you should be OK.
